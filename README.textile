h1. LitteChef

With LittleChef you will be able to get started more quickly cooking with Chef.

h2. Overview

You can think of this like a pocket Chef. You don't need to worry about installation, repository synching, nor Chef Server authentication. You also won't have to remotely edit cookbooks, or commit little changes just to test things.

Downloading LittleChef is all you need to get you started.

h3. Deploying

There is a helper command that allows to 

h2. Requirements

* Python 2.6+
* fabric 0.9.2 (python-fabric package in Ubuntu and Debian based distros)

h2. Installation

There is none. You just need to install the required packages and download and uncompress LittleChef. To start cooking change to the @littlechef@ dir and always issue commands from there, calling @./cook@

h2. Usage

h3. Disclaimer

Carefull what you do with your nodes!:
Great Chef: What do I always say? Anyone can cook.
Little Chef: Yeah. Anyone can, that doesn't mean that anyone should.

h3. Preparing and cooking

To be able to issue commands to remote nodes, you need to enter a user and password at the top of @littlechef/fabfile.py@ by editing @env.user@ and @env.password@

h3. Deploy

There is a command that allows you to deploy the chef-client/-solo related packages using the opscode repository. Note that if you already have Chef Solo installed on your nodes, you won't need this. Also, if you previously installed Chef using the Gem procedure, please don't try this! Installing Opscode's packages on top of it will be a mess.

@fab deploy_chef:MYNODE@

h3. Cook

* @./cook -l@ will show a list of all available commands.
* Cooking a recipe on a particular node:  @./cook node:MYNODE recipe:MYRECIPE@
  Note that the first time this is run for a node, a configuration file will be created at @nodes/hostname.json@. You can then edit this file to override recipe attributes for example. Further runs of this command will not overrite this configuration file. You can force the saving of the run by passing @recipe:MYRECIPE,save=True@.

@fab node:MYNODE recipe:MYRECIPE,save=False@ => to not overwrite existing config file
@fab node:MYNODE role:MYROLE@
@fab node:MYNODE role:MYROLE,save=False@ => to not overwrite existing config file
@fab node:MYNODE configure@ => Configures node as specified in the config file
@fab configure@ => Configures all nodes

h3. Consulting the inventory

@fab list_nodes@
@fab list_nodes_with_recipe:MYRECIPE@
